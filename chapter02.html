<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him.
<br>Good day to you, Little Red Cap.
<br>Thank you, wolf.
<br>Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?
<br>To grandmother's.
<br>what are you carrying under your apron?
<br>Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength.
</p>
<p>Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?
<br>Her house is good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place," said Little Red Cap.
<br>The wolf thought to himself, "Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me. She will taste even better than the old woman. You must be sly, and you can catch them both.
He walked along a little while with Little Red Cap, then he said,<br>Little Red Cap, just look at the beautiful flowers that are all around us. Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school. It is very beautiful in the woods."
