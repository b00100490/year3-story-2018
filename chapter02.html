<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a Grey Wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and she was not afraid of him.
<br>Good day to you, Little Red Cap.
<br>Thank you, Wolf.
<br>Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?
<br>To grandmother's said Little Red Cap.
<br>What are you carrying under your apron?
<br>Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. My Mother and I baked yesterday, and they should be good for her and give her strength.
</p>
<p>Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?
<br>Her house is good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place," said Little Red Cap.
<br>The wolf thought to himself, "Now that sweet young thing is a tasty bite for me. She will taste even better than the old woman. You must be sly, and you can catch them both for dinner.
<br>He walked along a little while with Little Red Cap, then he said,<br>Little Red Cap! just look at the beautiful flowers that are all around us. Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school. It is very beautiful in the woods."
</p>
<p>
Little Red Cap opened her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancing to and fro through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers, she thought to herself, "If a take a fresh bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased indeed. Anyway, it is still early, and I can be home on time." She ran off the path into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods.</p>
