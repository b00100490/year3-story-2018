<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. It suited her so well, and because she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.</p>
<p>One day her mother said to her,<br>Come Little Red Cap? Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. When you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first."
<br>I'll do everything just right," said Little Red Cap, as she waved goodbye to her mother.</p>
