<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.
<br>Who's there?
<br>Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door.
<br>Just press the latch, called out the grandmother. I'm too weak to get up.
<br>The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he put on her clothes, put her cap on his head, got into her bed, and pulled the curtains shut.</p><p>
Little Red Cap had run after the flowers. After she had gathered so many that she could not carry any more, she remembered her grandmother, and then continued on her way to her house. She found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and everything looked so strange that she thought,<br>Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's."
<br>She called out, "Good morning!" but received no answer.
<br>Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!
<br>All the better to hear you with.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!
<br>All the better to see you with.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!
<br>All the better to grab you with!
<br>Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!
<br>All the better to eat you with!
