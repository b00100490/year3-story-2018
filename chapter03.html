<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.
<br>Who's there?
<br>Little Red Cap. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door.
<br>Just press the latch, called out the grandmother. I'm too weak to get up.
<br>The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he put on her clothes, put her cap on his head, got into her bed, and pulled the curtains shut.</p><p>
Little Red Cap had run after the flowers. After she had gathered so many that she could not carry any more, she remembered her grandmother, and then continued on her way to her house. She found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and everything looked so strange that she thought,<br>Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's."
<br>She called out, "Good morning!" but received no answer.
<br>Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!
<br>All the better to hear you with.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!
<br>All the better to see you with.
<br>Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!
<br>All the better to grab you with!
<br>Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!
<br>All the better to eat you with!
<br>The wolf had scarcely finished speaking when he jumped from the bed with a single leap and ate up poor Little Red Cap. As soon as the wolf had satisfied his desires, he climbed back into bed, fell asleep, and began to snore very loudly.
</p>
<p>A huntsman was just passing by. He thought, "The old woman is snoring so loudly. You had better see if something is wrong with her."
He stepped into the parlor, and when he approached the bed, he saw the wolf lying there.<br> "So here I find you, you old sinner," he said. "I have been hunting for you a long time."
<br>He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly. After a few cuts he saw the red cap shining through., and after a few more cuts the girl jumped out, crying, "Oh, I was so frightened! It was so dark inside the wolf's body!"
And then the grandmother came out as well, alive but hardly able to breathe. Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead.
<br>The three of them were happy. The huntsman skinned the wolf and went home with the pelt. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Cap had brought. And Little Red Cap thought, "As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to."
